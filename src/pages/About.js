            <p>MovieStash is a website which the user can search movies and save it. I create this
                website as my react learning project. I got the inspiration to create this website from the website MyAnimeList.com which is
                a similiar website except MyAnimeList.com is for anime and have more features. All the movies data that are displayed in this
                website are provided from themoviedb.org. And for the background image for this website, i got it from pixabay.com.
